        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Startup Shell began in 2012 when a few students decided to clear out a storage room on campus to work on their projects. The Shell organically grew from this group of friends to a space where entrepreneurs and hackers from across campus came to build their ventures. Fast forward to 2015, and we have 100+ current members and 50+ alumni with over 60 startups that have passed through the space.</p>
